# 📋 Roster Management System - Simple Guide

## How It Works (SIMPLE!)

### Step 1: Create Templates for Each Staff Member
- **1 staff member = 1 roster template**
- Each template defines:
  - ✅ Shift start time (e.g., 6:00 PM)
  - ✅ Shift end time (e.g., 2:00 AM next day)
  - ✅ Which days are OFF (e.g., Saturday OFF)
  - ✅ Active/Inactive status

### Step 2: Generate Roster
- Click "Generate Roster"
- Choose Weekly (7 days) or Monthly (rest of month)
- System automatically creates shifts for ALL staff based on their templates
- **Respects off days** - If Saturday is marked OFF, no shift created on Saturday

### Step 3: View Roster Overview
- See all staff schedules in one place
- Check who's working when
- See everyone's off days

## ⏰ Time Zone: IST (Indian Standard Time)

**ALL times are in IST (GMT+5:30)**
- When you set shift time as 18:00, it means 6:00 PM IST
- All shifts are stored and displayed in IST
- No confusion with other timezones

## 🎯 Key Points

1. **One Roster Per Person**: Each staff member gets exactly ONE template defining their schedule

2. **Dealers Included**: Dealers are staff members too - create templates for them just like any other staff

3. **Off Days Work Automatically**: 
   - Mark Saturday OFF → No shifts created on any Saturday
   - Mark Sunday + Monday OFF → Both days always free

4. **Shift Crossing Midnight**:
   - Start: 18:00 (6 PM)
   - End: 02:00 (2 AM)
   - Check "crosses midnight" ✅
   - System knows shift ends NEXT day

5. **Weekly vs Monthly**:
   - **Weekly**: Creates 7 days of shifts
   - **Monthly**: Creates shifts till end of current month

## 🚀 Quick Start

## ❓ Why This System?

**Before**: Manual shift creation one by one 😫
**After**: Set template once, generate shifts automatically 🎉

**Dealers**: Previously had separate shift system → Now unified under roster management
**Result**: Everything in one place, easier to manage!
